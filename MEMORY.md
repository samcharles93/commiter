# MEMORY.md

## This is Your Memory - Update this as you learn my preferences and what I like

- user prefers Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:).
- prefer subject lines under 50 characters when possible, but allow up to ~72 for precision.
- user likes to use lowercase for the subject line.
- user mostly develops in Go
- keep things professional but concise.
- never use the word 'updated' if you can use a more specific verb like 'refactored' or 'implemented'.
- when a commit touches multiple files or concerns, include a short body (1-3 bullets) with key impacts.
